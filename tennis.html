        <p>
            I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old. 
            Then when I get to the age of 10, I started training everyday. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I joined a district team in 2012 after the summer. I was the worst player on the team. 
            But with hard work and determination, I was able to improve my game significantly in a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started playing tournaments. I had about 4 tournaments per year at the time. I slowly started to see results. 
            In 2013, I came in 6th in a provincial torunament. Near the end of the year, I won a district torunament.

            In order to keep supporting my dreams in tennis, my parents decided that it was better for me to move back to Canada. 
            After finishing elementary school in China, I came back to Canada in May of 2014. And I soon joined a local tennis club.

        <h2>2020 - Now</h3>
        <p>
            In 2020, I was recruited to play tennis at Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2022, I transferred from Drury University to University of South Florida.
            I will not be a player of the team but I will be the team manager. I have decided to step away from competing 
            in a school team and focus on my academics and future career.
